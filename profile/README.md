## üîß Simplicity First

At Open Bench Tools, we believe that open-source hardware should not only be functional but also **simple to build, assemble, and understand**.  
All our projects are designed with:
- Common and easy-to-find components.
- Clear and minimal documentation.
- Focus on reproducibility by makers and small labs.

Our goal is to make advanced bench tools **accessible to everyone**, from beginners to experienced professionals.

## üõ† Design & Development Tools

We adopt **open-source and cross-platform tools** for the entire lifecycle of our projects:

### Hardware Design
- [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)  
  Open-source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) suite used for schematic capture, PCB layout, and documentation.

### Enclosure and Mechanical Design
- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)  
  Open-source 3D CAD software used to design all enclosures and mechanical parts, which are made available for **3D printing**.

### Firmware Development
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)  
  Modern and powerful embedded development platform supporting multiple boards, frameworks, and toolchains.
- [Arduino](https://arduino.cc/)  
  Widely adopted and beginner-friendly firmware framework, ensuring easy adoption by the community.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
  Cross-platform code editor, used with PlatformIO and Arduino for streamlined development.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced maker, your contribution is welcome! Here are some great ways to get involved:

- Use our projects and [share](mailto:tiagodepaulasilva@gmail.com) photos, demos, or feedback with us.
- Report bugs or suggest improvements by opening Issues.
- Propose new project ideas or help expand existing ones.
- Improve schematics, PCB layouts, or BOMs (cleaner design, cheaper parts, better sourcing).
- Create educational content ‚Äî explain how a circuit works, introduce components, or break down key concepts.
- Design and share mechanical parts like enclosures, panel cutouts, or printable STLs.
- Help write or improve documentation, build guides, and assembly instructions.
- Translate documentation into other languages to make it accessible to more people.
- Share your forks, modifications, or remixed versions.
- Record short videos or timelapses of your builds or setups.
