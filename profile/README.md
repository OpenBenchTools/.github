## 🔧 Simplicity First

At OpenBench Tools, we believe that open-source hardware should not only be functional but also **simple to build, assemble, and understand**.  
All our projects are designed with:
- Common and easy-to-find components.
- Clear and minimal documentation.
- Focus on reproducibility by makers and small labs.

Our goal is to make advanced bench tools **accessible to everyone**, from beginners to experienced professionals.
