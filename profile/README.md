## üîß Simplicity First

At OpenBench Tools, we believe that open-source hardware should not only be functional but also **simple to build, assemble, and understand**.  
All our projects are designed with:
- Common and easy-to-find components.
- Clear and minimal documentation.
- Focus on reproducibility by makers and small labs.

Our goal is to make advanced bench tools **accessible to everyone**, from beginners to experienced professionals.

## üõ† Design & Development Tools

We adopt **open-source and cross-platform tools** for the entire lifecycle of our projects:

### Hardware Design
- [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)  
  Open-source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) suite used for schematic capture, PCB layout, and documentation.

### Enclosure and Mechanical Design
- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)  
  Open-source 3D CAD software used to design all enclosures and mechanical parts, which are made available for **3D printing**.

### Firmware Development
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)  
  Modern and powerful embedded development platform supporting multiple boards, frameworks, and toolchains.
- [Arduino](https://arduino.cc/)  
  Widely adopted and beginner-friendly firmware framework, ensuring easy adoption by the community.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
  Cross-platform code editor, used with PlatformIO and Arduino for streamlined development.
